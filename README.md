# Product Description
It is a simple game where the users' stress level is monitored on the top left corner of the screen. The users will have to avoid the stress creators like Angry boss, Confusion(Depicted by this emoji =>ðŸ˜•) and Fear (Depicted by this emoji => ðŸ˜±), taking in one of  these would increase the stress level meter by 100 points. Users can take the stress busters like Yoga, Sleep and Laughter to decrease their stress level meter by 25 points. Once your stress level reaches a certain point, you'll be given an alert "Your stress levels have become very high!! You need to have some rest." Simple and relieving right? 

# Problem Statement
It is predicted that by the end of 2021, roughly 20% of India's total population will be suffering from mental illness and would be having mental health issues. According to the numbers, 56 million indians suffer from depression and another 38 million Indians suffer from anxiety disorders.Stress can cause mental health problems, and make existing problems even worse. Thus, this game provides an escape from some common issues which people suffer in their day-to-day life  which can affect their mental peace and can cause anxiety issues. 

# Solution Proposal
The solution we designed is a stress monitoring game where the user will have to watch out for the stress creators and look out for the stress busters in order to maintain their stress levels. Reaching a certain level of stress would warn the user that their stress levels have become very high and they should take some rest.
